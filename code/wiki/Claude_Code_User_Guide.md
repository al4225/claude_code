## Introduction

### üéì What is Claude Code and Why It Exists

- **Claude** is Anthropic‚Äôs powerful AI model, designed to understand language, logic, math, and code more deeply than typical chatbots. Its latest version, **Claude‚ÄØOpus‚ÄØ4**, released on **May‚ÄØ22‚ÄØ2025**, is especially strong at multi‚Äëstep reasoning and large‚Äëcodebase tasks (e.g. coding), scoring high on software‚Äëengineering benchmarks.
- **Claude Code** is a terminal‚Äëbased assistant that uses Claude Opus‚ÄØ4 or Sonnet‚ÄØ4 to help developers *write*, *debug*, *navigate*, and *refactor* code directly from the command line. It comes fully integrated with Git, test systems, and other tools you already use [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

‚ùå Bad example:
"write code"

‚úÖ Good example:
"Please create a Python function that takes two number parameters, returns their sum, and includes error handling"
```

### 2. Plan Before Execute
```
Recommended workflow:
1. "Help me plan the implementation steps for a user login system"
2. "Now let's implement step 1: create user model"
3. "Continue with step 2: create login interface"
```

### 3. Provide Context
```
‚úÖ "Add a new API endpoint /users to the existing Flask application"
‚úÖ "Write tests for calculator.py using pytest framework"
```

### 4. Iterative Improvement
```
1. "Create a simple calculator"
2. "Add square root functionality"
3. "Add history feature"
4. "Optimize the UI design"
```

### 5. Use Code Review
```
Regular use:
"Review the code I just wrote, check for potential issues"
"How's the performance of this code? Any optimization suggestions?"
```
